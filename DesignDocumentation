Legends: Monsters and Heroes
Design Documentation
1. Introduction
Legends: Monsters and Heroes is a Java-based turn-based role-playing game (RPG) where players control Heroes engaged in battles against Monsters while navigating a grid-based GameMap. The game includes character classes, different monsters, spells, weapons, items, and a turn-based battle system, designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
2. Overall Architecture
The system follows a modular layered architecture, divided into:
- Core Game Logic: Game, GameMap, Battle
- Entities/Models: Hero, Warrior, Paladin, Sorcerer, Monster, Dragon, Exoskeleton, SpiritMonster
- Items: Weapon, Armor, Potion, Spell
- Utils/Data Handling: FileLoader
- Input/Output: GameIO
- Main Driver: Main class
4. Major Class Descriptions
Game.java: Core controller of the application, initializes map, handles gameplay flow.
Main.java: Starts the game by calling new Game().start().
GameMap.java: Manages the 2D map grid consisting of Tile objects.
Tile.java & TileType.java: Represents each cell of the map.

5. Character System
Living.java: Abstract base class for all living entities.
Hero.java: Hero attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Experience, Money.
Monster.java: Monster attributes: Damage, Defense, DodgeChance.

7. Battle System
Battle.java handles turn-based combat between Heroes and Monsters.
Damage calculation, turn sequence, rewards distribution.
9. Design Principles Used
Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Modular Design, Factory Pattern.
12. Conclusion
This project successfully applies OOP principles to build a modular and extensible RPG system.
